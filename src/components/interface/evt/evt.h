/***
 * The event API is the analog of `epoll` or `kqueue` (similarly
 * traditional `select` or `poll`). It enables a thread to await an
 * event on any number of resources (instead of blocking waiting for a
 * specific resource while ignoring the rest). It is *event
 * triggered*, which is why I compare to `epoll` and `kqueue`. This
 * means that once it tells you that a resource has a pending event,
 * you *must* flush all of those pending events as they will not be
 * re-reported. It tells you when a resource mode-changes from "not
 * available" to "available". For example, it notifies you when data
 * becomes available in a channel, when a timer has triggered, or when
 * a lock becomes available. However, it does *not* tell you *if* they
 * are *currently* available (level-triggered). Thus, this API is
 * often paired with non-blocking interfaces for the resources so
 * that, for example, a channel can be cleared out without blocking on
 * it, before awaiting for it using the event API again.
 *
 * A typical event loop looks something like:
 *
 * ```c
 * enum {
 *     MY_CHAN_SRC_T  = 1,
 *     MY_TIMER_SRC_T = 2,
 *     MY_LOCK_SRC_T  = 3,
 *     // ...
 * }
 * struct chan *c = chan_alloc(&c);
 * struct evt e;
 * evt_init(&e);
 * chan_evt_add(c, e, MY_CHAN_SRC_T, (evt_data_t)c);
 * // ...
 *
 * while (1) {
 *     evt_data_t evtdata;
 *     evt_src_t  evtsrc;
 *     if (evt_wait(&e, &evtsrc, &evtdata)) return -EINVAL;
 *
 *     switch (evtsrc) {
 *     case MY_CHAN_SRC_T: {
 *         channel_handler((struct chan *)evtdata); // clear out the channel
 *         break;
 *     }
 *     // ...
 *     default: err_panic("event source unknown")
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that if you don't want to trust the event component for your
 * own integrity, then you should not (as above) create the channel
 * source from the pointer. An event component could return an
 * arbitrary pointer and cause trivial faults and/or corruption. This
 * this, in the general case, an index should be passed, and used to
 * look up the channel. You can use the static_alloc.h API for this,
 * for instance.
